through faulting and folding in the shallow crust where brittle deformation can occur thrust faults form which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock because deeper rock is often older as noted by the principle of superposition this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones movement along faults can result in folding either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault deeper in the earth rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold upwards creating or where it downwards creating if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards they are called and respectively if some of
