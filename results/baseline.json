person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle it is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down from the perspective of the person in the car the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction since there is no experiment that can distinguish
